# CNN Classifier  

A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other.  The main steps involved in a CNN are as follows:

## 1) Convolution of Image with a Predefined Filter
## 2) MaxPooling 
## 3)Flattening
## 4)Fully Connected Layer

In this project we are trying to classify Dirty Plates from those which have already been cleaned by creating a CNN classifier. As always the Classifier requires a dataset on which it can be trained which was obtained from Kaggle. This dataset contains the images of plates which are either dirty or cleaned. 

The training set has been constructed of 21 already known cleaned images and 22 already known dirty images. The CNN classifier will be trained on this dataset to best fit the already known dataset following which the test-set will be unleashed to calculate how accurate this CNN Classifier actually is.
